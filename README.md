# CinemaVault
Have you ever wanted to recommend a movie or show but details fade the longer time passes? Cinema vault is an application that stores movies and tv shows that you have watched and if you found them recommendable using a 10-point rating system.

**Components that will be installed to use: Microsoft .Net Framework 4.7.2 (x86 and x64) AND SQK Server 2019 Express LocalDB.**

Helpful feedback would be greatly appreciated.
