# CinemaVault
An application that stores movies and tv shows that you have watched and if you found them recommendable.

Required components: Microsoft .Net Framework 4.7.2 (x86 and x64) AND SQK Server 2019 Express LocalDB (Will be automatically installed upon setup).

If you only wish to download the program, the folder "AppInstallation" contains everything necessary to run the setup.exe.

The downgit link below will pull only the folder mentioned above without needing to download the entire project zip to install this application.

Link for folder download: https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/AmperSanders/CinemaVault/tree/main/AppInstallation

Any helpful tips would be greatly appreciated.
